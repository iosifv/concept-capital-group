      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>If you are an investor in <strong>Concept Capital Group LTD</strong> and have experienced missed payments or reduced communications, this page provides neutral, practical steps and resources to help you coordinate with others. This is educational and community-focused — not legal or financial advice.</p>

      <h3>Immediate steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather documentation: contracts, payment records, emails, receipts, and any communication from the company.</li>
        <li>Record dates and amounts for missed payments and keep screenshots of any relevant pages.</li>
        <li>Attempt direct contact via official channels (email and website contact forms) and log attempts.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Community coordination</h3>
      <p>Joining our WhatsApp group helps coordinate actions, share templates (e.g., demand letters), and pool knowledge of local regulation or lawyers others have used. <a href="/">Return to the community hub</a> or <a href="/seo-article.html">refresh this guide</a>.</p>

      <h3>Legal & regulatory checks</h3>
      <p>Depending on your local jurisdiction, there are often regulatory bodies or agencies that handle investment fraud or unlicensed financial activities. Consider contacting local regulators, a consumer protection agency, or a qualified solicitor who specialises in investor recovery.</p>

      <h3>Template resources (examples)</h3>
      <p>We keep sample templates in the group for demand letters and data requests — share and adapt with care.</p>

      <h3>Staying safe online</h3>
      <p>Avoid scams: never share private keys, bank PINs, or passwords. When coordinating with others, validate identities and exercise caution when sharing documents that contain sensitive personal data.</p>
